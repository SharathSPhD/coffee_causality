Tutorials
=========

A detailed interactive tutorial for this project is available at:
`Coffee Causality Tutorial <https://sharathsphd.github.io/coffee_causality/intro.html>`_

The tutorial is organized into four main parts:

Part A: Data Generation and Initial Analysis
----------------------------------------------
This tutorial covers:

* Setting up the synthetic coffee shop data generator
* Visualizing daily sales patterns
* Analyzing weather and competitor effects
* Creating visual stories with the data

Key concepts demonstrated:
   * Data generation with hidden confounders
   * Time series visualization
   * Multi-dimensional data plotting
   * Building composite visualizations

Part B: Statistical Analysis
-----------------------------
This section explores:

* Correlation analysis between variables
* Feature relationships and distributions
* Linear regression modeling
* Model performance evaluation

Key concepts demonstrated:
   * Correlation matrices
   * Pair plots
   * Multiple linear regression
   * Model diagnostics and residual analysis

Part C: Causal Analysis Methods
--------------------------------
Advanced analysis including:

* Instrumental Variables (IV) analysis using weather as an instrument
* Double Machine Learning (DML) for causal effects
* Analysis of direct effects versus total effects

Key concepts demonstrated:
   * IV estimation
   * First stage and reduced form relationships
   * Double ML implementation
   * Treatment effect estimation

Part D: Information Flow Analysis
----------------------------------
Final analysis covering:

* Transfer entropy calculations
* Network visualization of information flow
* Causal network interpretation
* Final insights and conclusions

Key concepts demonstrated:
   * Transfer entropy principles
   * Network analysis and visualization
   * Information flow dynamics
   * Causal network interpretation
